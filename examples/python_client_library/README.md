# ONTAP REST Python Client Library Examples

The repository folder **python_client_library** contains samples scripts you can refer to understand how the ONTAP REST API can be accessed through the Python client library.

# Preparation

Before running the example scripts, make sure the following packages are installed:

* python 3.5 or later
* requests 2.21.0 or later
* marshmallow 3.2.1 or later

See the [PyPI netapp-ontap](https://pypi.org/project/netapp-ontap/) package web page for more information.

**Note:**

a) If you are using ONTAP 9.6 "netapp_ontap" Python client library module, make sure to replace `from netapp_ontap import NetAppRestError` header with `from netapp_ontap.error import NetAppRestError` header.  

b) [utils.py](https://github.com/NetApp/ontap-rest-python/blob/master/examples/python_client_library/utils.py) module in this directory is used by the other example modules in this directory. It is not meant as a stand-alone application. Hence, the utils.py code module needs to be in the same directory structure as of the code executed by the user.

For e.g: If user executes list_volumes.py code in a directory structure a/b/c, ensure utils.py code exists in the same directory a/b/c.
